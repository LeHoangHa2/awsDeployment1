**Implementing EC2 Performance Optimization with Custom AMI and User Data Scripts** plays a key role in enhancing computing infrastructure performance by ensuring availability, efficiency, and cost-effective operations. **Amazon EC2** is one of the core services of AWS, providing the flexibility to create and manage virtual machines. However, launching and configuring **EC2 instances** from default AMIs can be time-consuming, inconsistent, and potentially vulnerable if not properly configured.

- By adopting this system, you gain several benefits:

+ Develop an automated system to create Custom AMIs pre-installed with essential software, libraries, monitoring tools, logging, and security hardening configurations.

+ Optimize EC2 instance boot time to under 30 seconds, enhancing scale-up speed and reducing downtime.

+ Design and implement advanced User Data Scripts to automate the entire initial configuration process of instances, ensuring consistency, security, and maintainability.

+ Measure and benchmark performance in detail between Custom AMIs and Standard AMIs using criteria such as boot time, CPU/RAM/Disk I/O performance, operational cost, security level, and scalability.

+ Deploy at least 50 EC2 instances for testing to evaluate feasibility in large-scale real-world environments.

+ Conduct cost analysis to compare traditional deployment methods with the optimized system using Custom AMIs.

+ Perform a comprehensive security assessment of Custom AMIs and the automated configurations, ensuring compliance with AWS best practices such as CIS Benchmark, OS hardening, logging, and IAM permissions management.
