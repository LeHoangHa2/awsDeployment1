To **optimize EC2 performance with Custom AMI and User Data Scripts**, you need to configure an IAM Role that grants the necessary permissions for these services. In this preparation step, we will create an IAM Role to ensure that EC2 instances have the required access to perform optimizations. Once the IAM Role is created, we will proceed with configuring and deploying the EC2 instances.
