# Optimizing EC2 Performance with Custom AMIs and User Data Scripts


### Overall
Optimizing the performance of EC2 instances on the AWS platform by using pre-configured Custom Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) and automated User Data Scripts to streamline the initialization process. The goal is to reduce instance boot time, improve runtime efficiency, and enhance system stability when deploying EC2 instances at scale. This solution is especially beneficial in environments that require rapid, consistent, and cost-effective server provisioning.
